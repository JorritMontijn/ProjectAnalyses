%% further analyses
%{
1) how do confusion matrices of ori decoding differ between alb/bl6? 

2) is neural code of nat movs more variable during eye movements in NOT than Ctx? 

3) does info in NOT predict info in V1? 

4) spike shape NOT vs Ctx 

%to do:
A) plot tuning in NOT as function of location in NOT: is a recording closer to the border more likely
to be tuned?

B) plot tuning as second-closest pair decoding

C) plot results as separate recordings (and make selection of recordings based on visual
responsiveness)

D) plot example NOT cells that respond visually but are not orientation tuned
